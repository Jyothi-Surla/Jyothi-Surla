## About Me

I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg with hands-on experience in developing Python-based automation tools, machine learning pipelines, and computer vision systems. I’ve contributed to AI-driven projects at Genpact and TCS, and I’m currently exploring research-focused and practical AI applications.

I’m actively looking for working student or internship roles in AI, ML, or Python development — ideally tied to a thesis opportunity.
